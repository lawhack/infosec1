    "We can store our data in nice rows and columns. So what? Data we can't interact with is not very useful. We need some way of accessing and manipulating this data. In other words, we'd like to do computation. We interact with data in a database by making queries. A **query** is a request for information. The most common language for making queries in relational databases is the Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is surprisingly intuitive and quite powerful. We won't have time to learn at all it's capable of. There are entire courses dedicated to SQL and relational databases! We're going to focus on getting data out of an existing database.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many kinds of queries we can make of a database with SQL. We could ask to modify data or delete data or add new data. We're just going to learn the most basic kind of SQL query, the `SELECT` statement. This kind of query lets us retrieve data from a database. Here is an example query for the table above:\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's try this query out. We're going to run this SQL query *inside a Python program*. Lawhack has a real SQL database with the data from our product example ready and waiting for queries. Let's connect to it and make a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have to tell our Python script how to establish a connection to the SQL database. We need a username and password. I've supplied both of those in the script below. We also need the name of the datbase. In this case, it's \"example\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've established the connection, we need to get a \"cursor\". A cursor is a datatype that lets us interact with the database. We can ask it to execute queries and retrieve data for us. Once we have the cursor, we can ask it to execute our query. Our query is just a string.\n",
    "\n",
