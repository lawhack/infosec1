    "Why did we learn SQL and HTML? Why did I show you Python scripts building HTML and SQL queries? We're trying to learn how more modern websites work.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you interact with a modern website, the HTML you see is customized for you. The server doesn't just display the same static HTML documents to all of their users. Each user sees their own version of the web page. How does that happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripts on the server dynamically generate the HTML documents we typically see today. When your browser makes an HTTP request for a URL, the server runs a script to generate the HTML and sends it back to your browser in an HTTP response. We call code that generates the HTTP response **server-side scripts** or **backend code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a script that generates a simple customized HTML document. It accesses your username through an operating system envirnment variable. The script then sticks the results into the contents of the HTML. The variable `document` is *just* a string of HTML. The username is *just* a string. We're putting them together with that fancy % operator and storing the resulting string in the variable `customized`. Again, `customized` is *just* a string. Until the very last line, this example server-side script is just building a string of HTML. The last line of the script renders the HTML string in an iframe."
