    "# Debuggers\n",
    "\n",
    "Debuggers are programs used to test programs. Debuggers are essential tools for hackers. A hacker needs to understand precisely how a program works to manipulate it to their ends. Specifically, debuggers are used in reverse engineering (or \"reversing\" in hacker slang.) Frequently, an hacker's target is code written by a stranger. Often, the hacker doesn't even have the source code. A debugger allows a hacker to slowly work to understand the inner workings of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, what does a debugger do? A debugger allows us to run a program with complete control. We can pause execution at a specific line (a \"breakpoint\") and inspect the value of variables. We can execute the program one line at a time (\"step\") and watch the result of each line of code. Debuggers will even allow us to view the raw machine code and bytes of memory as the program executes. The most \"hacker\" experience you'll have in this class will involve carefully inspecting memory in a debugger. We're building toward that moment. In this notebook, we're laying the groundwork for future 1337 hax. Hang in there!"

The first thing we should do to use GDB is compile our program specially for gdb. We'll use gcc with the -g flag. This will add extra information to the compiled binary for the debugger.\n",
