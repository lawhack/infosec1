The Linux kernel was written in C. The Python interpreter was written in C. C is a fundamental technology for software. To understand how software works and how it can be exploited, we need to understand C.\n",

    "## Understanding C Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at the code in hello.c and try to understand what it's doing. The first line imports a library called \"stdio.h\". The formatting is a little strange, but this line of code does roughly the same as our import statements in Python. It brings in a code library implemented by someone else that we can use in our program. This particular library is for manipulating standard input and output (i.e. input from the keyboard and text output to the screen.) In this case, we import the stdio library to access the printf function. Most basic C programs import this library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing to understand is that all of our code in C has to be put into functions, and the function named main is always automatically called first. We need to have a main function to do anything, because it's the starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions look a little different in Python. Remember that blocks in Python start with a : and then we tab over each line inside the block. Blocks in C start with { and end with }. That's why the body of the main function begins and ends with curly braces. With the exception of \"int\" instead of \"def\", the function \"main\" looks very similar to a Python function. What does \"int\" mean? We'll come back to that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The printf function in C does essentially the same job as print does in Python. return also does the same job in Python and C. Why does main return 0? All programs in C return a value to operating system to let it know how things went. By convention, returning 0 means \"our program terminated with no errors.\" Other return values are possible, but we won't need to worry about that.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more curiosity. In C, all statements end with a ;. In English, we end statements with a period. In C, they end with a semicolon. Strangely enough, semicolons have a similar meaning in Python. They're just not required in Python. Imagine if periods were optional in English.\n",

If we ask for a buffer of size 50, it can hold at most 50 elements.\n",

We then fill the buffer up and print it using for loops. As you can see, for loops in C are a little different than they were in Python. In C, have to declare the loop variable (in this case i). Then we have a series of 3 statements in parentheses. The first tells how to initialize the loop variable, the second is a Boolean condition of when to stop, and the third tells how to increment the loop variable each time.\n",
