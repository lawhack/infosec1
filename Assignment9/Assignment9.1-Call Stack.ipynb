    "When we compile C code, the resulting x86 code manipulates a special stack called the **call stack**. This is a stack implemented by the processor itself. The purpose of this stack is to preserve the context whenever we make a function call. What does that mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a juggler is performing. She gets stopped mid-routine by some emergency. Somehow, our imaginary juggler is so talented, she remembers exactly where each ball was when she stopped. As soon as the emergency is over, she recovers the routine from the exact moment she stopped. In this analogy, the juggler is our program and the balls are variables. The emergency is a function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we're in the middle of executing a program, variables have been assigned values. The program is not finished using them yet. If we suddenly encounter a function call, we have to drop everything and start executing that function instead of the program we're currently working on. How do we keep track of all of those variable and register values we assigned? How do we remember which line of code we were executing before we got interrupted? That is what we mean by \"preserve the context\". We have to remember *everything*, so we can pick up *exactly* where we left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technology that solves this problem is the call stack. We push all of the values we want to preserve onto the call stack, including the address of the line of code we want to come back to. We call this the **return address**. When we're done executing the function, we can pop all these values off the stack, restore them, and continue execution.\n",

    "The x86 call stack lives in memory. The assembly we will see is all 32-bits. There are 8 bits in a byte and $\\frac{32}{8}=4$, so the memory addresses, registers, and most of the values we'll deal with are 4-bytes long. This is sometimes called the **word size** of the processor. For 32-bit addresses, smallest memory address is 0x00000000 and the largest address is 0xFFFFFFFF. Memory for a process is laid out something like this:\n",

    "The memory address of the top of the stack is stored in register ESP, called the **stack pointer**. The x86 **push instruction** subtracts 4 from the value of ESP, then stores data in the memory address in ESP.

The **pop instruction** does the opposite. It retreives the values stored at ESP, then adds 4 to ESP.\n",

For example, \"x/wx 0xffffd3b8\" shows us the data stored in memory adress 0xffffd3b8. Let's look at the data stored in memory address ebp-0xc.
