    "# Block Ciphers\n",
    "\n",
    "Block ciphers are encryption algorithms that work on fixed-length chunks (blocks) of binary data. We divide the plaintext into fixed-length blocks and feed them into a function (along with the key) that encrypts the block into a ciphertext block. For each block B, we encrypt part of the message $ciphertext_B=E(key,plaintext_B)$. Repeating this process, we can encrypt the entire message block by block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decryption works similarly. We decrypt the ciphertext block by block. $plaintext_B=D(key,ciphertext_B)$. Importantly, this means the encryption function must have an inverse. That inverse is the decryption function. Furthermore, the pair of encryption and decryption functions must only work when the correct key is supplied. As you can imagine, designing a block cipher is quite difficult."

    "## Padding\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem in the previous section is that the length of our message wasn't a multiple of 16 bytes. In other words, our message was slightly shorter than a block. To correct for this, we need to **pad** the message (add a little bit extra.) The standard way to do this is to figure out how many bytes of padding are needed, encode that number in a byte, and then repeat that byte to pad out the message (e.g. if we need twelve bytes of padding, repeat the number 12 twelve times.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there's no built-in padding function. Let's write our own padding function. If the message is $n$ bytes long and the block size is $b$ bytes, how many bytes do we need to pad? The message will fit into $\\frac{n}{b}$ blocks with some remainder. How do we find the remainder? Our old pal modulo $n \\bmod b$. Our message fills those blocks. How many blocks are left over? $b - n \\bmod b$.\n",

You might not have noticed, but you can go back and try it out for yourself.\n",
