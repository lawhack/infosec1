The encryption process replaces each letter with the letter k after it in the alphabet. Let's say our key k=5. Every A in the plaintext is replaced by F, and B's would be replaced by G's. The last 5 letters of the alphabet are replaced by the first 5 letters (i.e. it wraps around like the modulo operator.) Y's are replaced with D's and Z's are replaced by E's.\n",

We can use slicing to get the last part of the alphabet (plaintextAlphabet\\[5:\\]everything from F to Z) and and the first 5 letters (plaintextAlphabet\\[:5\\]=A to E).
