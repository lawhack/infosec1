    "\n",
    "Computer scientists usualy represent the alphabet with the mathematical variable $\\Sigma$. In mathematical terms, the alphabet is the set of all possible symbols, for example $\\Sigma=\\{A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\\}$ is an alphabet you are familiar with.\n",

    "We can build strings from $\\Sigma$ by putting them in a sequence. \"BANANA\", \"NEPTUNE\", and \"QWERTY\" are three examples of strings on the alphabet $\\Sigma$. Note that \"banana\" is not a string on this alphabet, since our alphabet only includes the upper-case letters. We could build a new alphabet that includes all of the upper and lower-case letters or an alphabet that contains all of the characters you can type on your keyboard. For now, we'll just stick with the upper-case letters for our examples. "

Some things we type from the keyboard have special meaning when we type them, like the \"tab\" key or the \"enter\" key. What if we want to include something like \"tab\" in a string?
