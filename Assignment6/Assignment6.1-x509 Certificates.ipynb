    "With the cryptographic primitives you've learned, we can achieve confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and even a bit of accountability. All of this, however, depends on our ability to distribute public keys reliably. If Mallory can trick Alice into accepting her public key instead of Bob's public key, she can subvert all of our security goals. We need a way to distribute public keys with trust. This is why X.509 was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know. X.509 sounds like a Top Secret government program in a superhero movie. Unfortunately, it's is not nearly so exciting. X.509 is an internet standard for establishing trust. X.509 is ultimately just a protocol to distribute public keys reliably. Keep that in mind. When you go deep into the details of how X.509 works, it's easy to lose sight of the big picture. Try not to forget that X.509 is a way to give someone a public key in a way they can trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "X.509 is a standard for **certificates** (sometimes shortened to \"certs\"). Certificates are files that contain the public key of some entity (e.g. Bob's public key.) A certificate's purpose is to establish to the reciever that it is a genuine document, so the receiver can trust that the public key it contains is authentic. We don't want Mallory to be able to forge a certificate with her own public key. \n",
    "\n",
    "Certificates can be downloaded in a format called PEM. I downloaded the cert for this website (jupyter.lawhack.net) using Firefox. The cert is included with this assignment in a file called \"jupyter_lawhack_net.crt\". Let's read the contents of that file into a string called \"pem\" and take a look at it."

Typically, public keys for CAs are stored in the web browser or operating system. From those keys public keys, we derive all of our trust and security while browsing the web.\n",

The code builds another object (fancy custom datatype) from the certificate string, then uses the scope operator to run a function on it. That much we've seen before in other examples, even if we don't quite know how it works.\n",
