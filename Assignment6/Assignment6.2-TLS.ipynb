    "This connection uses TLS version 1.2 with cipher suite ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384. Let's break down this cipher suite and describe each of its components. Our TLS connection uses Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) for key exchange, ensuring forward secrecy. We haven't talked about elliptic curve (EC) cryptography, but this is essentially a more modern variant of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. The law school's public key is authenticated using RSA. The messages sent over our connection are all encrypted using AES with a 256-bit key. Remember, block ciphers require a mode of operation. The block cipher mode of operation in this cipher suite is GCM or \"Galois Counter Mode\". GCM is a more sophisticated version of the counter mode of operation (CTR) we discussed. The integrity of each message is protected with an HMAC based on SHA-384, an SHA-2 variant with a 384-bit hash digest."

I didn't want to print the entire response, because it's very long and quite boring. This is what the raw data looks like that your browser recieves as you browse the web.
