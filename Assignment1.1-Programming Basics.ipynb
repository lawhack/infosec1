    "This is our first Jupyter Notebook. Notebooks are a way to interactively explore computing concepts without installing a lot of software. Basically, they act like a website where you can type in some code and run it. In this particular notebook, we will explore some very basic programming concepts. You'll learn enough Python to treat it like a fancy calculator. Hopefully, you'll also get the hang of Jupyter Notebooks. Let's get started.\n",

    "## Literals\n",
    "Literal represent values meant to be interpreted exactly as they're written. There's nothing profound or fancy going on here. For example, 2 represents the number two. If we input this number, Python outputs that number. While this may not be very exciting, we have to start somewhere.\n",

To type code in, just click anywhere in the cell and then start typing. When you're done, you can click the \"Run\" button above to see the output. Try typing in the literal 2 and running the program."

    "## Expressions\n",
    "Literals are data, and data doesn't do anything on its own. If we could only use literals in our computer programs, computers would not be very useful. Fortunately, we have ways to manipulate data. **Operators** are symbols like + and - that allow us to interact with data and produce new values. By combining literals and operators, we can create **expressions**. Expressions are combinations of symbols that we can evaluate to produce a value. Expressions look a bit like simple math equations.\n",

Again, don't be afraid to change the code in the cells and see what happens. It's the best way to learn."

We  gain a little more flexibility and power by storing the results of our expressions in **variables**. Variables allow us to give a name to a value and store it in memory. We assign a value to a variable using a special operator called the **assignment operator**, which looks like an equals sign =. Below we have an assignment statement. Running this cell produces no output, because we stored the value in memory."
