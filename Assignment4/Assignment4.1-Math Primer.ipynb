    "\n",
    "In grade school, you learned how to factor numbers. For a number n, factors are numbers that evenly divide n. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. You probably also learned that a number can be decomposed into a unique prime factorization. This is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Prime numbers are like ingredients we can combine together to cook up all the other numbers (composite numbers.) The prime factorization of 20, for example, is $2^2*5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a number from its prime factors is easy. Multiplication of two numbers is relatively straightforward. You learned how to multiply two numbers together when you were very young. Though it would be tedious, you could multiply large numbers together. For numbers with n digits, the multiplication algorithm you learned in elementary school takes about $n^2$ steps. Computer scientists know even faster multiplication algorithms, so a computer can multiply together extremely large numbers very quickly. Here are two prime numbers multiplied together."
