    "\n",
    "Futhermore, there are some weaknesses in RSA if we're not careful about the $M$ we use. We won't go into the details, but we typically need to pad the message (make it longer) to protect against those weaknesses. This means we have even **fewer** bytes for our message!"

    "\n",
    "Alice can use a cryptographic hash. She can compute the message digest $D=H(M)$. She can then use RSA to encrypt the **message digest** $S=D^e \\bmod n$. This is known as Alice's **digital signature**. She can send her signature $S$ and the message $M$ to Bob. Bob can decrypt the signature using Alice's public key $S^d \\bmod n$. He can then compute the hash digest of the message himself $H(M)$. The result of these two computations should match (both should result in $D$). If they do, Bob has validated Alice's signature.\n",
