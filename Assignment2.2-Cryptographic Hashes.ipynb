We can think of the output as just a binary number. When we input a string, the function returns a number. If we input in the same string again, we get the identical number out. Hashing different strings may or may not result in the same number, but the length of the output will always be the same.\n",

For a binary string of length 2, we have 4 possibilities \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", and \"11\". For a binary string of length 3, we have 8 possibilities \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"111\". This is going to take too long. Let's try to generalize!\n",
